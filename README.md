<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to the official repository for our Adolescent Health Chatbot, a cutting-edge tool designed to support adolescents in navigating the complexities of Sexual, Reproductive, and Mental Health (SRMH). This chatbot, developed using the latest advancements in AI and natural language processing, aims to provide timely, accurate, and confidential assistance.

Our mission is to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to bridge the gap in adolescent health education and services, particularly in areas often hindered by cultural and societal barriers. We are committed to improving health literacy and empowering adolescents to make informed decisions about their health.
